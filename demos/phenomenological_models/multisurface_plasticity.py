# # Multi-surface plasticity model
#
# In this example, we show how to implement a multi-surface elasto-plastic constitutive model that combines several yield surfaces.
#
# ```{admonition} Objectives
# :class: important
#
# This demo is to illustrate how to:
#
# - Define a custom multi-surface plasticity model in `jaxmat`.
#
# - Combine several yield surfaces and associated yield stresses within the same constitutive update.
#
# - Use Fischer-Burmeister functions to tackle plastic complementarity, thereby avoiding an explicit tracking of active/inactive yield surfaces.
#
# - Validate the implementation by visualizing the resulting stress paths in the $(p, q)$ (mean–deviatoric) stress space.
# ```
#
# For the sake of illustration, we consider a Drucker–Prager yield surface describing the main frictional effect in the plasticity of several geomaterials. We also add an elliptic cap in compression and a hydrostatic tension cutoff. Assuming no hardening, we plot the final yield surface obtained from various strain-driven load paths in the hydrostatic/deviatoric $(p,q)$-plane.
#
# ## Multi-surface plasticity setting
#
# We consider $i=1,\ldots, N$ different yield surfaces. Each of them is associated with its own yield stress function $f_i(\bsig)$ and yield stress $\sigma_{0i}$. Here, we do not consider any hardening so the yield stresses are all constants. However it is possible to account for independent isotropic hardening of each surface. Hence, each yield surface is associated with its own plastic multiplier, which we denote $p_i$ [^1].
#
# [^1] : This is an abuse of notation regarding the classical cumulated plastic strain of standard $J_2$-plasticity, we should rather denote them $\lambda_ i$. We chose the notation $p_i$ to keep the implementation as close as possible to simpler plastic behaviors.
#
# ### Generalized flow rule
#
# For a smooth yield surface $f(\bsig)$, we now that the associated flow rule is expressed as $\dot{\bepsp}=\dot{\lambda}\partial_{\bsig} f$. In the non-smooth case, the flow rule generalizes as follows:
#
# $$
# \dot{\bepsp}=\dot{\lambda}\bn \quad \text{where } \bn\in \Nn_{f}(\bsig)
# $$
#
# where $\Nn_f$ is the normal cone to the plastic surface $f$. For smooth parts $\Nn_f(\bsig)=\{\partial_{\bsig} f\}$ contains only a single normal vector element. In the case of many surfaces intersecting at $\bsig$, $\bn$ can take any value belonging to a positive convex combination of the normal vectors $\bn_i=\partial_{\bsig}f_i$ of each surface:
#
# $$
# \dot{\bepsp} = \sum_{i=1}^N\dot{\lambda}_i \partial_{\bsig}f_i(\bsig)
# $$
#
# ### Plastic complementarity conditions
#
# The evolution of these quantities is determined implicitly by a return-mapping–like algorithm formulated as a root-finding problem. Classically, we should choose which surface is active, compute a projected stress and then check if the surface remains active. This active-set strategy is relatively cumbersome to implement. Instead, the use of complementarity functions such as Fischer-Burmeister functions allows to avoid explicitly testing which surface is active or not. Elastic and plastic evolution are simultaneously accounted for by requiring that, for all plastic mechanism $i$:
#
# $$
# \text{FB}(\sigma_0-f_i(\bsig), \Delta p_i) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad f_i(\bsig)\leq \sigma_{0i},\: \Delta p_i \geq 0, \: (f_i(\bsig)-\sigma_{0i})\Delta p_i=0
# $$
#
# As a result, it is even possible with this formulation to account for two plastic mechanisms being simultaneously activated.
#
# ```{warning}
# This approach does not remove all issues associated with non-smooth yield surfaces. Convergence issues might still appear, especially in the apex region.
# ```
#
# ## Implementation
#
# We begin by defining an `InternalState` defining the model internal state variables: the total plastic strain $\bepsp$ and several plastic multipliers $p_i$ for each yield surface. Here, the plastic multipliers are represented as a vector of size $N$ (`n_surf` in the code).
#
# We define the internal state as a PyTree-like Equinox dataclass with statically known attributes (`n_surf`), and dynamic arrays (`epsp` and `p`) that can be efficiently traced by JAX.
#
# ```{admonition} Why __post_init__ is used
# :class: tip
#
# Because `equinox` modules are immutable, fields that depend on other parameters (like the number of yield surfaces `n_surf`) cannot be directly initialized in the constructor.
# The `__post_init__` method provides a clean way to perform such initialization after object creation.
#
# Here, it allocates the array `p` with zeros of size `(n_surf,)`, ensuring that the internal variable dimensions automatically match the number of yield surfaces, the structure remains static and JAX-traceable, and the module follows Equinox’s immutable data model.
#
# In short, __post_init__ lets us safely set up shape-dependent fields while keeping the model compatible with JAX transformations like `jit` and `vmap`.
# ```

# The `MultiSurfacePlasticity` class defines the main constitutive behavior.
# It extends `SmallStrainBehavior` and is defined by several different fields: an elastic model, a list of yield surfaces, and a list of their corresponding yield stresses.
#
# During initialization, the __post_init__ method checks that the number of yield surfaces matches the number of yield stresses, then sets the internal state (InternalState) with the correct number of plastic multipliers.
# This ensures consistency and avoids manual setup when extending the model to more surfaces.
#
# The `constitutive_update` method then performs an implicit return-mapping procedure using `optimistix.root_find`. The residuals correspond to the plasticity complementarity conditions of each surface, enforced using Fischer-Burmeister functions, and the incremental generalized plastic flow rules which leverage the normals of each surface. Note that the final residual, called `res`, is a PyTree as a nested list/tuple and does not need to be flattened. All residuals are then solved together within a single implicit solve.
#
# Finally, the `@eqx.filter_jit` decorator enables JIT compilation for efficiency.

# ### Drucker-Prager yield surface
#
# Finally, the Drucker-Prager yield condition is expressed as a function of the first and second invariants $I_1=\tr(\bsig)$ and $J_2=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\bs:\bs}$ with $\bs=\dev(\bsig)$ as follows:
#
# $$
# f_\text{DP}(\bsig) = \alpha I_1 + \sqrt{J_2} \leq \tau_c
# $$
# where $\alpha$ controls the slope of the Drucker-Prager surface in the $(p,q)$ plane (can be related to a friction angle) and $\tau_c$ is the shear strength.
#
# Next, we instantiate the composite `MultiSurfacePlasticity` material by specifying an isotropic linear elastic model, a list of yield stresses and plastic surfaces.
# We then select some numerical values and instantiate the final behavior. Its `constitutive_update` method is then vectorized using `jax.vmap` to allow evaluation of multiple strain paths in parallel.
