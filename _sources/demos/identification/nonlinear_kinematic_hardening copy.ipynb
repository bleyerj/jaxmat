    "The material model considered here combines linear elasticity with a nonlinear hardening law. The Cauchy stress is given by $\\bsig=\\CC:(\\beps-\\bepsp)$. Hardening is described by the combination of a kinematic and isotropic mechanism. Both are described via a hardening potential $\\psi_\\text{h}(\\balpha, p)$, expressed as function of a kinematic hardening strain $\\balpha$ and the cumulated plastic strain $p$. Its derivatives provide the state laws for the corresponding kinematic and isotropic thermodynamic forces, namely:\n",

    "```{math}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_0$ is the initial yield stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution equations for the internal state variables are thus given by:\n",

    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\dot{\\bepsp} &= \\dot{\\lambda}\\dfrac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\bsig} = \\dot{\\lambda}\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\bsig} \\\\\n",

    "This generic hardening behavior is implemented in the class `jaxmat.materials.GeneralHardening` which relies on an elastic model, a constant yield stress $(\\sigma_0)$, a plastic surface and a combined hardening potential.

    "Thanks to automatic differentiation (AD), all sensitivities — including those passing through the nonlinear implicit return-mapping solver at each time step — are computed exactly and efficiently. This allows gradients to propagate seamlessly through both the material state updates and the time integration loop, without any manual derivation of tangent operators."
